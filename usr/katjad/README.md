##JavaScript LOGO turtles

This is a bit of a cheat (so far), because it is NOT a React project yet, but the plan is to turn it into one. 

There's only one file so far, when you run it in the browser, you can see a little circle drawing a line across the canvas. I want to add some controls and perhaps also the option to write code in a textarea. 

(There are of course already some implementations out there, but it's a good exercise and fun; I'd also like to try and make them walk in 3d like the ['Mincecraft Turtles'](https://github.com/tombh/mc-turtles/)) I did with Tom BH 2 years ago :) )
